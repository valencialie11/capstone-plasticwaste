# Data Visualisation Capstone
During my data science bootcamp, I was tasked to use R to make an interactive dashboard about anything. Since the problem of plastic waste that is plaguing our country is very severe, I opt to make an interactive dashboard about it and educate anyone who came across this!
It was definitely a difficult task but very rewarding because I was able to learn more about R and most importantly, how to persevere in the face of challenges.

## Dependencies
- shiny
- shinydashboard
- plotly
- tidyverse
- ggrepel
- lubridate

I'm definitely going to make another interactive dashboard when I'm free just because it's very fun! 
See you~
